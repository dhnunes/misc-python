Python 2 and Python 3 range() function are completely different.

Python 3 range() is just a renamed python 2 xrange() function.

Originally, both functions range() and xrange(), produce number that
could be iterated over a for loop, but with a small difference:

range() - returns a list with all numbers at once
xrange() - returns one number at time, as they are needed
